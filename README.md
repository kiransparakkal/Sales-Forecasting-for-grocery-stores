# Sales-Forecasting-for-grocery-stores
The project aims to develop a precise sales forecasting model tailored for grocery stores, utilizing historical sales data and influencing factors like store location, type, size, product details (type, weight, price), and in-store product visibility. The project encompasses data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the implementation of multiple forecasting models (Extreme Gradient Boosting, LSTM, Random Forest) to predict sales trends. Model performance will be assessed using metrics like MAE, RMSE, R2 and MAPE, with the best-performing model selected for optimization. Additionally, a user-friendly web-based interface will be created using Streamlit, allowing store employees to easily upload product data and receive sales predictions in CSV format. Future expansion possibilities and project evaluation will also be considered to enhance inventory management and forecast accuracy.
